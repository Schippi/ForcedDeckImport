Forced Deck Import - Import decks into your game

Hello,
I love to experiment with decks, but quickly run out of space for decks when i want to keep my staples. So i wrote an Autohotkey script that takes a Textfile and imports it into the game.
I also asked Ben, who made the Deckbuilder[forcedshowdown.decksforge.com] to implement an Export feature, to save the deck in the right format.

It sounds a bit complicated at first, but once you set it up its easy ^_^
To use it you need Autohotkey installed[autohotkey.com] - make sure you enable the Drag&Drop option
download the Script from Dropbox[www.dropbox.com]
Start Forced Showdown
Drag the Textfile you downloaded from the Deckbuilder onto the .ahk file to start the Import
Wait for the Script to execute

Note:
it only works for 1920x1080 in either fullscreen or borderlesswindow ( or you can fit the window on your screen with a monitor with higher resolution)
it will delete the last Deck of the contestant if needed
